## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

Vendora is designed with a classic **layered architecture**, promoting a clean separation of concerns and making the application easy to test, maintain, and scale.

* **Controller Layer**: The entry point for all API requests, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses and delegating business logic to the service layer.
* **Service Layer**: Contains the core business logic of the application. It is divided into interfaces and implementations to promote loose coupling and easy testing.
* **Repository Layer**: The data access layer, built using Spring Data JPA. It provides a clean abstraction over the database, allowing for easy data manipulation.
* **Domain Model**: A rich domain model with JPA entities (`model`) that accurately represent the core concepts of the application.
* **DTO Layer**: A dedicated layer of Data Transfer Objects (`payload`) to ensure a clean separation between the internal domain model and the external API, preventing data leakage and providing a stable API contract.
